The Bud King Ice Arena is home of the *Winona Winhawks*, the public school hockey team.

You can watch their hockey matches there for entertainment purposes, but thats not all. 

The arena also has **Free Skate** times where you and a group of friends

or family can gather to skate for few hours. They even offer **rentals** on skates if you don't have or own any. 

The facility is well maintained, with the ice being smoothed over with little to no bumps. Even more, the rink itself

has a disco ball that they turn on for a while when they change the music. They also have a second rink outside.
