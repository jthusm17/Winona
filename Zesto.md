# Zesto's

Zesto's, also know as *Penguin Zesto's*, is a popular local restaurant that serves food, as well as 

delictible treats like ice cream (I recommend the *Chocolate Dip*). It are located at both the East

and West ends of Winona, and close down after the Summer has passed. Sales tax is already added to the price tag,

and each item is has a well rounded cost, like a mediem cone for $2.50

Zesto's **East** is fashioned like a barn and serves customers outdoors.

Zesto's **West** is a more standard walk-in restaurant, but only holds tables outside the building. Both building's are outdoor themed,

and are popular summer choices for easy or confrotable meals.
