# Zesto's

Zesto's, officially known as *The Penguin Zesto's*, is a popular local restaurant that serves food, as well as 

delictible treats like ice cream (I recommend the *Chocolate Dip*). It are located at both the East

and West ends of Winona, and close down after the Summer has passed. Sales tax is already added to the price tag,

and each item has a well rounded cost. For example, a medium cone costs exactly $2.50

Zesto's **East** is fashioned like a barn and serves customers outdoors. You order and eat outside.

Zesto's **West** is a more standard walk-in restaurant where you order inside, but only holds tables outside the building.

They are popular summer choices for easy or confrotable meals or if you want some delicious ice cream.
